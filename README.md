# Dating App - Mini Project (JavaScript)

This is my first mini-project in JavaScript! It's a simple dating app that matches users based on their preferences. The app collects user data (name, age, gender, location, etc.) and compares it with a mock dataset to find compatible matches.

## Features:
- Collects user input with validation (e.g., age must be 18+).
- Matches users based on age range, gender preferences, and location.
- Displays matches in a user-friendly format.

## Technologies:
- JavaScript (ES6)
- HTML (for running in the browser)
- No external libraries or frameworks

## What I Learned:
- Working with JavaScript objects and arrays.
- Validating user input.
- Using loops and conditionals to implement matching logic.
- Running JavaScript in the browser.

This project was a great way to practice the basics of JavaScript and understand how to build interactive applications. Feedback and suggestions are welcome! ðŸ˜Š
